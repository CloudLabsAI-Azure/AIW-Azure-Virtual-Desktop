# Lab 14: Migration-Tools (Optional)


## Azure Migrate

Azure Migrate is a Microsoft service that provides a centralized hub to assess and migrate on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data to Azure.

Azure Migrate uses a dedicated component for the migration of existing Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) services. The Lakeside Systrack digital experience monitoring solution gathers and analyses data on your existing VDI infrastructure, in order to successfully migrate these workloads to Azure, which is what we recommend in your VDI migrations.



Azure Migrate can migrate several different types of workloads. It can assess and migrate your existing VDI and Remote Desktop Services (RDS) workloads directly into Azure. It can also migrate:

   - **Servers:** Assess on-premises servers and migrate them to Azure virtual machines.
   - **Databases:** Assess on-premises databases and migrate them to Azure SQL Database or to an Azure SQL Database managed instance.
   - **Web applications:** Assess on-premises web applications and migrate them to Azure App Service by using the Azure App Service Migration Assistant.
   - **Virtual desktops:** Assess your on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and migrate it to Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure.
   - **Data:** Migrate large amounts of data to Azure quickly and cost-effectively using Azure Data Box products.
