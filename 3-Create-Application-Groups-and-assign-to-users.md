# Lab 3: Create Application Groups and assign them to users

## **Scenario**

Contoso wants to restrict the access to the applications used by different teams in the organization. With Azure Virtual Desktop, admins can create unique application groups for users that require access to a specific set of applications. In this lab you’ll help Contoso to configure and create an application group and add applications to it.

## **Overview**

As explained in the General Hierarchy section, an Application Group is a logical grouping of applications installed on session hosts in the host pool. There are two types of application groups: 

1. RemoteApp 
2. Desktop 

### Exercise 1: Create Application Group

An application group of type ‘Desktop’, was created automatically while creating the Session Host in the previous exercise. In this task, we will create a new application group of type ‘*RemoteApp*’ and publish two applications in it. Also, we will assign users to both the application groups.

1. Navigate to the Azure portal,  and search for Azure Virtual Desktop in the search bar and select **Azure Virtual Desktop** from the search results.

9. In the **GS-AVD-HP** host pool select **Application Groups** under **Applications**. Then select **+ Add** in the **GS-AVD-HP - Application groups**

9. In the *Basics* tab, do the following configuration: 

   i. Leave the following parameters to default:
