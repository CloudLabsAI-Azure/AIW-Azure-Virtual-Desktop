# Exercise 2: Create Application Groups and assign to users

As explained in the General Hierarchy section, Application Group is a logical grouping of applications installed on session hosts in the host pool. They are of two types: 

1. RemoteApp 
2. Desktop 

### **Task 1: Create Application Group**

An application group of type ‘Desktop’ was created automatically while creating the Session Host in previous exercise. In this task, we will create a new application group of type ‘*RemoteApp*’ and publish two applications in it. Also, we will assign users to both the application groups.

1. Navigate to Azure portal, then search for *Azure Virtual Desktop* in search bar and select **Azure Virtual Desktop** from the suggestions.
