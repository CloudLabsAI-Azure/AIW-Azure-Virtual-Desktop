# Lab 7: Load Balancing methods


## **Scenario**

Contoso's AVD environment set-up is working smoothly. However, Contoso is confused about which load balancing to use in order to run the sessions efficiently. You will guide Contoso to explore different types of load balancing offered by Azure.

## **Overview**

Azure Virtual Desktop supports two load-balancing methods. Each method determines which session host will host a user's session when they connect to a resource in a host pool.
While configuring a host pool, we can select load-balancing methods as per the needs.

The following load-balancing methods are available in Azure Virtual Desktop:

 **1. Breadth-first**: Breadth-first load balancing, distributes new user sessions across all available session hosts in the host pool. 

 **2. Depth-first**:  Depth-first load balancing, distributes new user sessions to an available session host with the highest number of connections but has not reached its maximum session limit threshold.


## Exercise 1: Add new users to Azure Active Directory

1. In Azure Portal, click on the **Show portals menu (1)** button and select **Azure Active Directory (2)**.

   ![ws name.](media/lb34.png)

1. Click on **Users** under *Manage* blade.

   ![ws name.](media/2avd104.png)

1. Click on **+ New user (1)** and select **Create new user (2)** from drop-down to add a new user.

   ![ws name.](../Azure-Virtual-Desktop-v3/media-1/lab7-ex1-s3.png)

1. Add the following configurations under the *Basics* tab and leave the rest to default:

   - User principal name: **AVDUser01**
   - Display Name: **AVDUser01**
   - Click on **Review + Create** and click on *Create*

   ![ws name.](media-1/avd-l7-ex1-s4.png)

1. Click on **+ New user** and select **Create new user** to add one more user, then add the following configurations under *Basics* tab and leave the rest to default.

   - User principal name: **AVDUser02**
   - Display Name: **AVDUser02**
   - Click on **Review + Create** and click on *Create*
   
   ![ws name.](media-1/avd-l7-ex1-s5.png)

1. Both the newly created users will show up similarly as shown below. Copy the **user principal name** of both users and paste it into a text editor so that we can use it further.

   ![ws name.](media-1/Ex7-task1-step6.png)

1. Click on **AVDUser01** to open it. Then click on **Groups** **(1)** under *Manage* blade and select **+ Add memberships** **(2)**.

   ![ws name.](media-1/lab7-ex1-s7.png)

1. Click on the **permission - fslogixcontainer (1)** group and then click on **Select (2)**.

   ![ws name.](media/2avd43.png)

1. Click on **AVDUser02** to open it. Then click on **Groups** **(1)** under *Manage* blade and select **+ Add memberships** **(2)**.

   ![ws name.](media-1/lab7-ex1-s9.png)

1. Click on the **permission - fslogixcontainer (1)** group and then click on **Select (2)**.

   ![ws name.](media/L7E1S10.png)

1. Navigate to the host pool *GS-AVD-HP* and open **Application groups** present under *Manage* blade. Two application groups will be listed there.

    ![ws name.](media-2/Application.png)

1. Open application group **GS-AVD-HP-DAG** and click on **Assignments** under *Manage* blade.

    ![ws name.](media-2/assignments1.png)
   
1. Click on **+ Add (1)**, then in the search bar, type **AVD (2)** and select both **AVDUser01 (3)** & **AVDUser02 (4)** that we created earlier. At last, click on the **Select (5)** button.

    ![ws name.](media-2/L7E1S13.png)

1. Once done, the users assigned to the Application group will look similar to the image given below.

    ![ws name.](media-2/avdusers.png)
     
## Exercise 2: Update Passwords for the new users

Here, we will use Powershell to run a script that will change the passwords for the users created, as the user needs to reset the password after registering to AADDS. 

1. Inside the Jump VM, click on the Windows button look for **PowerShell (1)** and click on **Windows PowerShell (2)**.
   
   ![ws name.](media/lab7-avd1.png)
   
2. Run the following command in your terminal to set up your Azure account permissions locally.

   ```
   Connect-AzureAD
   ```
3. Your browser window will open and you will be prompted to authenticate to your Azure.

4. Login to Azure with the username **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />** and click on **Next**.
    
    ![](media/lab7-avd2.png)
    
5. Enter your password **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" />** and click on **Sign in**.
    
    ![](media/lab7-avd3.png)

6. Copy and paste the following script and hit **Enter**.

   ```
   Get-AzureADDOmain
   $domain = Get-AzureADDOmain
   $domain = $domain.Name
   $PasswordProfile = @{
   Password = 'Azure1234567'
   ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = $False
   }
   $users = @("AVDUser01@$domain","AVDUser02@$domain")
   $users
   $users | foreach{
   Update-AzADUser -UserPrincipalName $_ -PasswordPolicy DisablePasswordExpiration -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile
   }
   ```
 
7. The output of the script will be similar to the one shown below. The password for both **AVDUser01** and **AVDUser02** is reset to **Azure1234567**.

   ![ws name.](media/lab7-avd4.png)

   >**Note**: ***Username*** and ***Password*** for ***AVDUser01*** and ***AVDUser02*** is present in Environment Details tab.

## Exercise 3: Change and experience Load Balancing methods

1. Return to the Azure portal in your browser inside the **JumpVM**, search for *host pools* and click on **Host pool** from the suggestion to open it.

   ![ws name.](media/lb38.png)
   
1. Now click on **GS-AVD-HP** host pool to access it.

   ![ws name.](media-2/selecthp.png)
 
1. Under Manage Blade, click on **Session hosts**.

   ![ws name.](media-2/sessionhosts.png)
   
1. You can see that both session hosts have one Active session each.

   ![ws name.](media-2/sessionhosts1.png)
   
   >**Note:** This shows how users are distributed among different session hosts, under the *Breadth-first load balancing method*. The breadth-first method first queries session hosts that allow new connections. The method then selects a session host randomly from half the set of session hosts with the least number of sessions.
