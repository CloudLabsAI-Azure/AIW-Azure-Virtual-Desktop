# Lab 12: MSIX App Attach (Optional - Read-Only)

## **Scenario**

Contoso wants a few applications to be installed in all the session's hosts. So, Contoso decided to implement the MSIX app attachment in order to install the application across the session hosts and users should be able to access them. You will help Contoso to install one of the applications that is, the VLC, using the MSIX app attach feature.

## **Overview**

In this exercise, we will be implementing MSIX App Attach for AVD. MSIX app attachment is a way to deliver MSIX applications to both physical and virtual machines. However, the MSIX app attached is different from regular MSIX because it's made especially for Azure Virtual Desktop. MSIX removes the need for repackaging when delivering applications dynamically.
Refer to this link ``https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/what-is-app-attach`` for more information.
